# CHCGPT-Rockers
This is the repository for Call for Code 2020 for the submission by team CHCGPT-Rockers under the topic sustainability of energy.

# Short Description
## What's the problem?

Electrical energy is a necessity is our daily life and its comsuption is always increasing. But it is devived from coal and fossil fuel and other natual sources, which are non-renewable.
It is thus of high urgency that we try and use less amount of this energy.

## How can technology help?

Several attempts are already made to reduce the consumption, namely :
Solar panel for homes
energy efficient appliances
smart appliances

But there seems to be some gap, as the survey says that the consumption of the energy is increasing every year, and so is the production.

## The Idea

If every consumer can be involved in the attempt to preserve then a surging impact can be achived.
